    text: `I had the pleasure of managing Eduardo for about two months, and in that short time, he made a remarkable impact.\nEven as an intern, Eduardo impressed everyone by contributing significantly from his first week, despite the challenges of navigating the complex UI code at Salesloft. His ability to quickly understand and work with such a daunting codebase was truly impressive.\nWe collaborated closely on planning and migrating our Angular codebase to React. Eduardo's dedication and consistent work ethic played a crucial role in ensuring that we completed the migration on time. He consistently delivered on his tasks, often going above and beyond expectations.\nI have no doubt that Eduardo will be a top performer in any organization that has the good fortune to hire him. His skills, dedication, and positive attitude make him an asset to any team.`,
